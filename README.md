# ExpressJSNoteTaker

## Description 

The motivation behind the project was to create a website using express js with node where a user can save and write notes about activities throughout their day or any information they'd like to save. We built this application because it creates a website that is easy for users to use and navigate in order for them to organize their notes simply by saving their data to a json file. It solves the problem of functionality and creating an application with both the front end and back end that allows users to easily organize/seperate their notes on one page. I learned a lot about creating get, post and delete routes, and having different files in my code to work together and function properly.

## Installation 
First you have to run "npm init -y" to retrieve the package.json file (already provided in starter code)
Then you type in "npm i express" to install express in order to use it on the backend 
Type in "npm run start" to run the application and access the webpage
